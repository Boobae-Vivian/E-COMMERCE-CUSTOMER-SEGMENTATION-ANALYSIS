# E-COMMERCE-CUSTOMER-SEGMENTATION-ANALYSIS
## INTRODUCTION
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project aims to perform customer segmentation analysis for an e-commerce company using Python as the primary data analytics tool. By analyzing customer behavior and purchase patterns, the goal is to group customers into distinct segments to support targeted marketing strategies and improve customer satisfaction.  
The dataset provides a detailed view of customer transactions and interactions, offering insights into purchase frequency, spending habits, and engagement levels. This analysis will help businesses make data-driven decisions to enhance customer experience and optimize business strategies.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
1. Descriptive Statistics
- What is the average purchase value per customer?
- What is the distribution of purchase frequency among customers?
- What percentage of customers are one-time buyers versus repeat customers?
- What is the total revenue contribution of different customer groups?
- Are there seasonal trends or patterns in customer purchases?
2. Customer Segmentation
- How can we group customers based on their purchasing behavior?
- What are the characteristics of each customer segment (e.g., high-value vs. low-value customers)?
- How do different segments vary in terms of purchase frequency, order value, and engagement?
- What are the optimal number of clusters for segmenting customers using K-means?
- Are there outliers or unusual spending behaviors among customers?
3. Visualization & Insights
- What do customer segments look like when visualized using scatter plots or bar charts?
- How do average purchase value and frequency differ across segments?
- Can we identify patterns or trends using heatmaps or distribution plots?
- What visual insights can help in making data-driven marketing decisions?
